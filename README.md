# Soft Keep Inventory
A plugin created for a personal server to allow players to keep some items on death, rather than dropping everything.

## Features
- Set which item IDs players will keep on death
- Set which inventory slots players will keep on death
- Set if players should keep XP on death
- Three keep modes: all (noraml keep inventory), some (uses our new rules), none (normal behavior)
- Seperate keep mode for PvP kills

## Commands & Permissions
The plugin only has one command: `/ski reload` with the permission `softkeepinventory.reload`. This command will reload the config.
